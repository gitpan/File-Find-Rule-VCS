NAME
    File::Find::Rule::VCS - Exclude files/directories for Version Control
    Systems

SYNOPSIS
      use File::Find::Rule      ();
      use File::Find::Rule::VCS ();
  
      # Find all files smaller than 10k, ignoring any CVS files/dirs
      my @files = File::Find::Rule->ignore_cvs
                                  ->file
                                  ->size('<10Ki')
                                  ->in( $dir );

DESCRIPTION
    I find myself doing exclusion of CVS or Subversion directories over and
    over again in almost every major FFR thing I write.

    File::Find::Rule::VCS provides methods to exclude the version control
    directories of several major Version Control Systems. Initially, this is
    just CVS and Subversion, but if you have an snippit of FFR code for any
    other VCS, I'd be happy to take and include it.

METHODS
  ignore_vcs
      $FFR_object->ignore_vcs($vcsname);

    The "ignore_vcs" method excludes the files for a named Version Control
    System from your File::Find::Rule search. The name of the VCS is case
    in-sensitive.

    Names currently supported are 'cvs', 'svn' and 'subversion'.

    The use of none, or any other name will throw an exception.

  ignore_cvs
    The "ignore_cvs" method excluding all CVS directories from your
    File::Find::Rule search.

    It will also exclude all the files left around by CVS after an automated
    merge that start with '.#' (dot-hash).

  ignore_svn
    The "ignore_svn" method excluding all Subversion (".svn") directories
    from your File::Find::Rule search.

TO DO
    - Add support for other version control systems.

    - Add other useful VCS-related methods
